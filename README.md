üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

MySQL for database management

MySQL Workbench for ER diagram modeling

CSV Files for data import/export

SQL for schema creation and database operations

üöÄ How to Use

Import the ERR Diagram.mwb in MySQL Workbench to visualize the schema.

Execute Library Management.sql in your MySQL environment to create the schema.
