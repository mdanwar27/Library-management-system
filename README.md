**üìö Library Management System**

This Library Management System is designed to manage and track books, authors, publishers, library branches, borrowers, and book loans. It includes structured data in .csv format, a MySQL Workbench ER Diagram (.mwb), and a SQL script for creating the database schema.

**üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used**

1. MySQL for database management

2. MySQL Workbench for ER diagram modeling

3. CSV Files for data import/export

4. SQL for schema creation and database operations

**üöÄ How to Use**

1. Import the ERR Diagram.mwb in MySQL Workbench to visualize the schema.

2. Execute Library Management.sql in your MySQL environment to create the schema.

3. Use the .csv files to populate tables using tools like MySQL Workbench or through custom scripts.

**üß© Relationships (ER Diagram Overview)**

The ER diagram outlines key relationships:

1. Books are written by Authors and published by Publishers.

2. Each Library Branch holds multiple copies of each Book.

3. Borrowers can loan Books, and each loan has a due date and return date.
